Name of the project: My-first-website1

In my first Milestone project I decided to build a simple website using mainly HTML and CSS languages.
The goal of the website is to post pictures/videos from my previous work as wellas to promote my 
ongoing projects. Intitially the website was thought to be my individual digital space, but
as I was developing it I came tothe realization that filmmaking is most of the time a colective process
and instead of saying "I tell stories" I wrote instead "We tell stories".  Also, in about section I included 
a picture of my friend who worked with me in most of the projects as a producer and director. 


The website in the current stage has a very basic layout and some of the sections will be redesigned later as I get more 
coding experience. Once I learn more Java script I want to make my website more interactive. I have already seen youtube 
tutorial with the navbar I want for my website. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4MkGzoACpQ&t=1067s).

My portfolio section has only a few pictures, but later I want to divide it into two sections : past projects
( with different subsections and descriptions of the projectds plus videos/ pictures, so the web users can get an insight into ) 
and ongoing project/s also with a very detailed description and visuals. I want my followers/ potentials public
to be able to see my past work as well as ongoing projects. The website link will be also included into promo package ( posters/trailers/...)
for marketing purposes.


Technologies/sources I used while creating the website:

*HTML/CSS languages ( mainlty Code Institute modules, video tutorials)
*Bootstrap components (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)
*Fontawesome (https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/)
*google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
Youtube tutorials:

..etc.  In total I have seen more than 20 tutorilas to get an idea 
for my website

Also, Nabar and carousele was copied from one of the toutube videos. I made some subtle code changes 
to adjust it to my project's requirements.



My main challenges:

*I had problem maching the length of my navbar with the lenght on the main (carousele) picture/s.
The navbar is slighty too long and it creates a sort of gap on the right side of the screen ( not always visible). 
The same goes for the footer- there is the same type of a gap there too. Whenever I wanted to change some of the parameters 
the whole layout would start falling apart and I felt like I was loosing control over my code.
I have contacted Code Institute tutors, but they were not able to help me. One of the Slack community mememers, Anna G.,
was kind enough to run my code on her machine and suggested that I might be able to corrected later as I progress with my
coding skills.

*Another challenge was also related to the navbar. In the mobile mode my naigation bar is to big. It covers about 30% of the screen,
and it doesn't look presentable. 


Testing my website.

I have shrinked and stratched my website back and forth trying to see how it would look on different devices. 
I have also checked my code on CSS (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload)
and HTML validators (https://validator.w3.org/) to see if there's any errors and how I can correct them.

Deployment

I haven't deployed my website yet. Just got a link from the Slack community with an instructrional video on website deployment.
Also, I have found a Youtube video on how to deploy your website from github(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vk9i_QZQ) 
that will hopefully help me to finish my project successfully. 

Credits

I would like to thanks Anna G. from slack community for being a great support throughout the entire 
process of studing and creating the project. She wwas always there for me and helped me sort out some of the challenges.
